##  Introduction

I am a Postdoctoral Researcher in the Department of Business Administration at the University of Zurich.

My research focuses on sports economics and experimental economics. 

I earned my Ph.D. in Management and Economics from the University of Zurich in October 2024. Prior to my doctoral studies, I worked as a short-term consultant at the World Bank and as a research assistant at ETH Zurich.
