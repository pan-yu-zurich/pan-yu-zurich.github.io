Welcome! I am a PhD student in Management and Economics at the University of Zurich, focusing on sports and experimental economics. Previously, I worked as a Short-Term Consultant at the World Bank and as a Research Assistant at ETH Zurich.

My research interests include sports economics, experimental economics, and the application of advanced artificial intelligence techniques in economic research. I have several working papers exploring topics such as gender biases in performance evaluations, trust in robotics, and the superstar effect in professional football.
