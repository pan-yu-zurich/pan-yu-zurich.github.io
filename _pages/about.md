*The Superstar Effect on Perceived Performance in Professional Football: An Online Experiment* (Draft available upon request)

[Yu Pan](https://pan-yu-zurich.github.io/), [Marco Henriques Pereira](https://www.business.uzh.ch/de/research/professorships/som/Team/Marco-Henriques-Pereira.html), [Carlos Gomez-Gonzalez](https://www.carlosgomez-gonzalez.com/), [Helmut M. Dietl](https://www.business.uzh.ch/de/research/professorships/som/Team/helmutdietl.html)

- Abstract: We conduct a novel experiment to investigate whether football superstars consistently receive more favorable evaluations than non-superstars. Engaging 500 participants from Prolific, we randomly assign them to evaluate the same football videos with either visible or obscured players. In the control group, where players are visible, superstars receive lower performance ratings than non-superstars, challenging common perceptions. However, this trend is more intensified in the treatment group, where obscured identities result in even lower ratings for superstars, relative to non-superstars, suggesting a diminished superstar premium. These findings provide experimental evidence contributing to the literature on evaluation bias and the superstar effect.

*Agricultural Practices, Organized Workers and Female Political Empowerment: Evidence from Italian Mondine* (Draft available upon request)

[Luca Bagnato](https://lucabagnato.github.io/), [Yu Pan](https://pan-yu-zurich.github.io/), [Miriam Venturini](https://miriamventurini.github.io/#about)

  - Abstract: We study whether work practices adopted in recent history in agriculture influence the political empowerment of women in a European country. Focusing on Italy, we study the case of female rice weeders and their successful history of unionization and mobilization for better working conditions. Relying on an instrumental variable strategy to predict quasi-exogenous variation in rice production, we test whether the historical presence of female rice weeders predicts differences in measures of political empowerment during the second half of the XX century. We find that towns where rice production was historically relevant had higher support for divorce in the 1974 referendum, have more women in politics, and are more likely to have a nursery school. Our results suggest the importance of collective action of working women to achieve persistent female political empowerment.
