# üëã Welcome!

I am a PhD student in Management and Economics at the University of Zurich. 

My research interests include sports economics, experimental economics, and the application of advanced artificial intelligence techniques in economic research. By integrating advanced techniques from computer science and graphics technology, my studies transform everyday scenarios into controlled laboratories for investigating social science questions.

*Rewarding Men More for Success, Penalizing Women More for Failure?* 

[Yu Pan](https://pan-yu-zurich.github.io/), [Carlos Gomez-Gonzalez](https://www.carlosgomez-gonzalez.com/), [Helmut M. Dietl](https://www.business.uzh.ch/de/research/professorships/som/Team/helmutdietl.html)

- Abstract: We employ a novel experimental design to investigate gender biases in performance evaluations, specifically examining whether women receive less recognition for their successes and face harsher penalties for their mistakes compared to men. Using advanced artificial intelligence computer-generated imagery and motion capture techniques, we manipulate the perceived gender of tennis players while maintaining identical performances. Involving 3,755 representative U.S. Prolific participants, our experiments isolate and measure the causal effects of gender bias. Study 1 examines success recognition, revealing that evaluators use gender as a reference point, with men's performances rated better regardless of perceived gender. Study 2 investigates failure penalization, uncovering clear gender bias: women's errors are judged less severely when gender is concealed or perceived as men, while men's failures are rated more severely when perceived as women. These findings significantly contribute to understanding how gender bias operates differently in success and failure contexts, extending regulatory focus and role congruity theories in performance evaluations.

*When Robots Think and Feel: Will Trust Disappear?* 

[Yu Pan](https://pan-yu-zurich.github.io/), [Carlos Gomez-Gonzalez](https://www.carlosgomez-gonzalez.com/), [Gwen-Jiro Clochard]([https:](https://sites.google.com/view/gwen-jiro-clochard/home)), [Helmut M. Dietl](https://www.business.uzh.ch/de/research/professorships/som/Team/helmutdietl.html)

- Abstract: Previously limited to mechanical tasks, robots are increasingly performing thinking and feeling tasks. But how these roles requiring higher agency impact perceived trustworthiness remains unclear. We examine when and why humans trust robots, involving 2,309 Prolific participants and using advanced AI-generated content to create realistic video simulations. We capture clear treatment effects by randomly replacing human staff with robots performing identical tasks. Study 1 reveals that robots performing mechanical tasks are trusted more than those performing thinking/feeling tasks, while scenarios combining human staff and robots are perceived as more trustworthy than those with robots only. Study 2 shows that different types of robots are perceived with different levels of trustworthiness, but the previous effects remain true for both robots. Study 3 demonstrates that human supervision significantly increases trust, particularly for robots performing thinking/feeling tasks and in environments without human staff. These findings underscore the importance of perceived agency and human supervision in shaping trust, providing critical insights for the design and implementation of robotic systems.

*The Superstar Effect on Perceived Performance in Professional Football: An Online Experiment* 

[Yu Pan](https://pan-yu-zurich.github.io/), [Marco Henriques Pereira](https://www.business.uzh.ch/de/research/professorships/som/Team/Marco-Henriques-Pereira.html), [Carlos Gomez-Gonzalez](https://www.carlosgomez-gonzalez.com/), [Helmut M. Dietl](https://www.business.uzh.ch/de/research/professorships/som/Team/helmutdietl.html)

- Abstract: We conduct a novel experiment to investigate whether football superstars consistently receive more favorable evaluations than non-superstars. Engaging 500 participants from Prolific, we randomly assign them to evaluate the same football videos with either visible or obscured players. In the control group, where players are visible, superstars receive lower performance ratings than non-superstars, challenging common perceptions. However, this trend is more intensified in the treatment group, where obscured identities result in even lower ratings for superstars, relative to non-superstars, suggesting a diminished superstar premium. These findings provide experimental evidence contributing to the literature on evaluation bias and the superstar effect. (*Draft available upon request*)

*Agricultural Practices, Organized Workers and Female Political Empowerment: Evidence from Italian Mondine* 

[Luca Bagnato](https://lucabagnato.github.io/), [Yu Pan](https://pan-yu-zurich.github.io/), [Miriam Venturini](https://miriamventurini.github.io/#about)

  - Abstract: We study whether work practices adopted in recent history in agriculture influence the political empowerment of women in a European country. Focusing on Italy, we study the case of female rice weeders and their successful history of unionization and mobilization for better working conditions. Relying on an instrumental variable strategy to predict quasi-exogenous variation in rice production, we test whether the historical presence of female rice weeders predicts differences in measures of political empowerment during the second half of the XX century. We find that towns where rice production was historically relevant had higher support for divorce in the 1974 referendum, have more women in politics, and are more likely to have a nursery school. Our results suggest the importance of collective action of working women to achieve persistent female political empowerment. (*Draft available upon request*)
